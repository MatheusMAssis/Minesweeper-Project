# Minesweeper-Project

Built in Processing.py, this project is a recreation of a famous computer game called Minesweeper. 

## About

A Processing.py project that I started with the intention of recreating the famous game Minesweeper. As I used to play it a lot when I was younger, I thought it would be cool to remember about those times (and it was). The game has *three levels of difficulty*, all of them are based on the real levels of Minesweeper (varying the number of bombs and tiles).
